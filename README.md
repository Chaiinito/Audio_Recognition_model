## Hello!
Audio recognition model to move a slider from right to left or vice versa. Retrieved from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-audio-codelab#0

## What's in this project?
To train it, just take the html link, paste it in a new window, press one of the 3 buttons holding it for 3 seconds or until it takes 150 samples and speak, or make a sound, for example, whistle for left, snap your fingers for right and in noise just make noise or silence. In this way, when you give it train, the model will be trained with the samples. Later we give it in listen, and the model will be put to work, and when it listens a whistle it will move to the left a click to the right and when it detects noise the slider will not move.
